        <div class="sps"><h4>Fiery Lotus</h4>
        <p>There was an Asur called Tarakasura, who defeated the Devas and over turn their paradise. The only way to restore cosmic balance was by kiling him. But, Taraka had a boon: only a little baby who leads an army could kill him. The Devas wondered  how as to they  could produce a warror who was strong and mature enough to fight a battle even though he was a baby. They approached Brahma, who informed them, that such a child can only be produced by Siva.</p>

<p>On the request of Shakti and the Devas, Siva releases his power in the form of six fiery sparks and hands them over to Agni

        <li> Srisailam attracts lakhs of devotees on most months of the year,

         a 7 year old child, or a pregnant woman, would be able to visit in peace and harmony, 
         without worrying about heat or being jostled in a crowd.</li>

		<li> The green cover and the gardens have also been planned so that devotees get a place to meditation  & enjoy peace.</li>
